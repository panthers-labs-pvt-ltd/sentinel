## User Journey

### Client Onboarding

**Account Creation**: Client sign up Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Before the client interacts with Chimera, **Panthers Labs backend team** need to deploy Chimera services on Client Infrastructure. Here are the steps to be completed for readiness -

1. **Choosing Client Infrastructure** - Cloud or On-Premise
2. **Default Setup**: The backend team sets up default configurations for the client's organization - System Accounts, Default Groups and Accesses, Certificates, and other components for Kubernetes, AIML (Ray), Observability (Prometheus and Grafana), Orchestration(Temporal), API, and Metadata Manager Cluster with default project/namespace/domain. **Should this be on a single docker-compose or shell script?**
3. **Connecting to Key Services**: The backend team connects to the client's key services, such as incident and configuration management platform like ServiceNow, communication channels like Email Servers, Slack and Teams, GenAI services like OpenAI, User Authentication Services like LDAP, etc. Let's discuss any other services that need to be connected to Chimera.
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: The backend team sets up the client's organization structure. This includes setting up the client's account, defining line of business/strategic business units, and hierarchy of domains and subdomains including the organizational heads.
5. **Ontology and Taxonomy**: The backend team defines the ontology and taxonomy for the client's business conceptual data model.
6. **Final Step**: Chimera UI DNS set up and SSL certificate installation.

### Team Onboarding

1. **Initial Setup**: Users configure their workspace, including setting up data sources and defining access controls.
2. **Guided Tour**: A guided tour introduces users to the platform's features and capabilities.

Please see more [here](UI.md#user-flow)

### Data Source (or External) Onboarding

Data Sources or External Data Sources are the sources from which data is ingested into the platform and are typically not managed by Chimera. These sources can be databases, files, APIs, or other systems that contain data to be processed and analyzed.

When onboarding a new data source, users typically go through the following steps:

1. **Data Source Discovery and Configuration**: Users identify and connect data sources to the platform. This information can be stored in a metadata repository for easy access.
2. **Data Source Validation**: System should verify data source connectivity and data quality before ingestion. System assumes that data quality has been validated by data source owners. It is also assumed that these sources are golden sources and Chimera lineage stops at these sources.
3. **Data Source Ingestion**: Users can initiate or set schedule/event to data ingestion processes to bring data into the platform (Raw Layer). Please see details in the [Data_Ingestion.md](Data_Ingestion.md) document.
4. **Data Source Monitoring**: Users monitor data source health and performance to ensure continuous data flow.
5. **Data Source Management**: Users manage data sources, including updating configurations and troubleshooting issues.
6. **Data Source Governance**: System would automatically derive schema and other information. For missing information, users need to provide information in Catalog.
7. **Data Source Decommissioning**: Users decommission data sources that are no longer needed or relevant.
8. **Data Source Governance**: Users apply governance policies to data sources to ensure compliance and security. They should document data sources to maintain a comprehensive inventory and improve understandability and collaboration with users. Please see Catalog Management (??)
9. **Data Source Optimization**: System optimizes parameters for data sources for performance, cost, and efficiency.

Once onboarded, the data can be ingested.

### API Service

Before we get into any other service description, it is important to realize that all the Chimera services would API as base to interact with each other. Chimera API service is the core service that provides the RESTful API endpoints for all the Chimera services. The API service is responsible for handling user requests, authentication, authorization, and routing requests to the appropriate service. It also provides documentation for the API endpoints and allows users to interact with the platform programmatically.

You can find more details in the [API_Service.md](API_Service.md) document.

### Orchestration Service

Before going to on Data Ingestion, Processing, Storage, and other services, we need to understand the Orchestration Services. Some of the popular orchestration frameworks are [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), and [Dagstar](https://dagster.io/). Customers can choose to use any of these orchestrators - all the other Chimera services would work just fine with minor configuration updates. We however, use [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) as default. The reason we chose Temporal is because of its architecture to manage failures, network outages, flaky endpoints, long-running processes and more, ensuring that Chimera workflows or pipeline never fail.

Please see details in the [Orchestration_Service.md](Orchestration_Service.md) document.
